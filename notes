# First run the following command on a computer with a webcamera
> python Streamer.py -s 10.79.12.88 -p 8880
# where 10.79.12.88 is the IP address of the cloud server and 8880 is the port. To check IP just type
> hostname -I
# and copy the first IP address.
# In another terminal window on the computer, run
> python viewer.py -p 8080
# Then, run
> python StreamViewer.py
# on the server.

# (1) Edit the frame rate in Streamer.py by changing the sleep interval
# (2) Make sure the IP address and port of the streamer (your computer) is correctly specified in StreamViewer.py
#     IP address can be found by typing hostname in Terminal and copying the result. Port is generally okay at 8080.
# (3) Configure whether to send the mesh or the skeleton as payload in StreamViewer.py
